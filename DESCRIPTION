Description: The package performs cluster analysis via nonparametric density 
   estimation. Operationally, the kernel method is used throughout to estimate
   the density. Diagnostics methods for evaluating the quality of the clustering 
   are available. The package includes also a routine to estimate the 
   probability density function obtained by the kernel method, given a set of
   data with arbitrary dimensions.
